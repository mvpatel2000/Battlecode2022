Game 1 (eckleburg): loss
    * build order loss; we made too many miners and didn't make soldiers till it was too late
Game 2 (valley): win
    * bad early game; we lost a lot of soldiers and miners who ventured onto high (> 50) rubble and then multiple
        enemies walked into vision and finished them off
    * got pretty lucky with a vortex at the end that opened up a nice attack path
Game 3 (nottestsmall): win
    * looked pretty much flawless

Game 1 (squer): loss
    * opening build difference: we make 6 miners, they make 4 + 2 soldier
    * not necessarily the end of the world, because we actually hold on for a while and by round 226 we are at 3s5m to 3s2m
    * we have a significant eco advantage throughout this game; we should play a bit more defensively
    * we lose because we try to fight near their archons without build up critical mass
