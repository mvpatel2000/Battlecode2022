Micro heuristic

Approach: assign a score to each of the 9 possible squares to move to.

Score computation factors:
* Number of enemies that can attack that square
* Health of those enemies
* Whether they can move
* Number of allies weighted by their attack area overlap with that square
* Health of those allies
* Archon heal benefit
* Enemy archon heal benefit? (we may not know this)
* Rubble at that square and rubble at enemy squares
* Enemies I can hit from that square -- prioritize enemies with high (myHealth - enemyHealth)





                    // TODO: Stop moving around archon?
                    // TODO: Encourage moving towards targets?
                    // TODO: Points for being able to kill (finish off) someone?
                    // TODO: Don't flee into high rubble terrain?
                    // TODO: encourage aggressiveness if outnumbering?
                    // TODO: pursue enemy if low hp




- soldiers should run if taking bad fights
- be conservative when fighting near enemy archons / group up till we have critical mass
- we are not factoring in support
- higher health guys should lead the charge
- address known soldier micro issues (kite back into rubble)
